    <h3>lasagna, a traditional italian pasta recipe</h3>
    <p>Lasagna is a popular Italian dish made of stacked layers of flat pasta sheets, usually alternating with
       rich and flavorful fillings. The classic ingredients often include a savory tomato-based meat sauce, 
       creamy béchamel sauce, grated cheese (such as mozzarella and Parmesan), and sometimes vegetables like 
       spinach or mushrooms. The layers are assembled and baked until the pasta becomes tender and the cheese 
       on top turns golden and bubbly. The result is a delicious and comforting casserole-style dish enjoyed 
       by people worldwide.</p>

        <li>Vegetables (optional, e.g., spinach, mushrooms)</li>

      </ul>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, cook the meat (ground beef or Italian sausage) over medium heat until browned. Add onions, garlic, and any desired seasonings. Stir in tomato sauce and crushed tomatoes. Simmer for about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a separate saucepan, prepare the béchamel sauce. Melt butter, stir in flour, and cook for a minute. Gradually add milk while whisking to avoid lumps. Cook until the sauce thickens and becomes smooth.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to the recommended temperature (usually around 375°F or 190°C).</li>
        <li>Assemble the lasagna in a baking dish: Start with a layer of meat sauce, followed by lasagna noodles, then a layer of béchamel sauce, and a sprinkle of grated cheese. Repeat the layers until all ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of meat sauce and cheese on top.</li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the foil and continue baking for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese on top is melted and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Allow the lasagna to rest for a few minutes before serving to make it easier to slice and serve.</li>
        <li>Garnish with fresh herbs, if desired, and enjoy your delicious homemade lasagna!</li>
